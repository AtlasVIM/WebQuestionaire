This is a simple web questionaire I made to practice coding and for personal use for my DND players.
The website is very straightforward, it has DOM manipulation by pressing the Previous Question and Submit buttons. Then at the last question the Download Answers button is enabled, allowing you to download a .txt file of the questions and answers in JSON-like format.
Whenever you click submit your answers are saved, this allows you to see your still see your answers for previous questions. 
I used a very simple MVC structure, although I don't think it was entirely necessary as the program doesn't use multiple routers, controllers, services, models or views, though it was useful for encapsulation and delegation purposes.


I uploaded it to a aws server -> http://character.creation.questionaire.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/#Question
